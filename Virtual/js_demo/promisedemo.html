    <h3>Promises Demo</h3>
    <p>Promises are also another way to handle asynchronous programming in JS, where it deals loke a Promise in a real life like how we gurantee that
        we are hoing to do something in the future for sure.....
    </p>
    <p> 
        Promise object has 3 states
        <br>
        1) Pending : Initial state, before the promise actually succeds or fails...
        2) Resolved : Promise is been hept i.e it has completed the promise action.
        3) Rejected : Unable to keep the promise here... i.e, it is failed to keep it....
    </p>
